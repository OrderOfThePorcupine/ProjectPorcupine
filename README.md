## About

Project Porcupine was created to serve two purposes:

1. To act as a tutorial to teach people how to make a full,
  complex, and multi-featured game inside of Unity (as opposed
  to the more typical one-off, single-feature tutorials that
  are more common).

2. To provide a basic skeleton for any game that requires a
  tile-based map with self-governing agents (i.e. characters)
  as well as highly customizable objects (i.e. XML/Lua defined
  furniture.)  To this end, we would be making a program themed as
  a starbase-construction game -- though there's no reason that 
  someone couldn't produce something with a wildly different theme
  or purpose (including not being a base-building game at all).

**However, our true ultimate goal is to produce a community-developed
base building game in a similar style to Dwarf Fortress or RimWorld!**

You can download and play already built 'weekly' versions for Windows, Mac, and Linux [here](https://bintray.com/orderoftheporcupine/ProjectPorcupine/Prebuilt-Binaries).

However, these are merely 'snapshots', a preview of the current development build, and are not representative of any type of release. They may contain errors, bugs, partially completed features, and other potential issues.  If you open a bug report please include what week you are using (either the week number or the date is fine) as this will help us find the bug easier and determine if your error has already been fixed.
